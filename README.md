## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process

1Ô∏è‚É£  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   



*Data Cleaning:
-Removed transactions with negative Quantity and UnitPrice.
-Handled canceled transactions by filtering them out during RFM calculations.

*Duplicate Entries:
-5,194 duplicates (1% of data) were removed

***1.1. Explore data***

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e887836-596d-4696-8c21-1122de6b888c)

 
 ```python
data.info()

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 541909 entries, 0 to 541908
Data columns (total 8 columns):

‚úÖ "Description" and "CustomerID" columns have 1454 and 135080 missing values respectively.  

‚úÖ InvoiceDate and CustomerID are in wrong datatype.  

‚û°Ô∏è Missing Data:  
- Removed null CustomerID rows.  
- Dropped Description column due to limited analytical value.  

‚û°Ô∏è Data type:  
- InvoiceDate => convert to Datetime type  
- CustomerID => convert to object type



```python
print('DataFrame dimension: ', data.shape)
     
DataFrame dimension:  (541909, 8)

print(data.describe())
     
            Quantity      UnitPrice     CustomerID

max     80995.000000   38970.000000   18287.000000
```

Detect why "Quantity" and "Price" have negative values (<0)

```
# subset dataframe to indicate rows that have negative values 
print('Row with negative Quantity (<0)')
data[data['Quantity'] < 0]

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ddb000-c1d1-4c05-946b-0e680d22043f)

```python
# The symbol "C" in "InvoiceNo" indicates a canceled order. Check if a negative Quantity always corresponds to a canceled order.  
# Create a column to check the cancellation status of the data.  
data['InvoiceNo'] = data['InvoiceNo'].astype(str)
data['check_cancel'] = data['InvoiceNo'].apply(lambda x: True if x[0] == 'C' else False)

# Check if the reason for Quantity < 0 is due to order cancellation.
data[(data['check_cancel'] == True) & (data['Quantity'] < 0)].sort_values('Quantity')
data[(data['check_cancel'] == True) & (data['Quantity'] <= 0)].sort_values('Quantity')
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5df3a5f7-a8f1-41d3-b603-d4de1f5c4bf6)

```python
# Check orders without "C" (canceled) that still have a negative quantity
data[(data['check_cancel'] == False) & (data['Quantity'] < 0)].sort_values('Quantity')
data[(data['check_cancel'] == False) & (data['Quantity'] <= 0)].sort_values('Quantity')

data[(data['check_cancel'] == False) & (data['Quantity'] < 0)]['Description'].value_counts()
```

</p>  

=> Orders with quantity < 0 that are not canceled are considered erroneous orders.

**Handling abnormal data values**   
‚û°Ô∏è Remove negative quantity values in df calculate RMF, keep in df data to get insight
‚û°Ô∏è Remove excessively large quantity values
‚û°Ô∏è UnitPrice < 0 => incorrect values => remove

***1.2. Create a canceled orders table.***

*The project focuses on segmentation based only on successful orders, so I will analyze canceled orders separately.*

```python
# Invoices with a "C" at the beginning are canceled transactions.
cancelled = data['InvoiceNo'].astype(str).str.contains('C')
# Assign 0 to non-canceled orders and 1 to canceled orders.
cancelled.fillna(0, inplace=True)
cancelled = cancelled.astype(int)
cancelled.value_counts()
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5631a1e9-36fa-4623-bb41-3c9defa68160" alt="image">
</p>


*=> Number of canceled orders: 9288*  
*Calculate number of cancelled transactions and percentage:*  
```python
c1 = data['order_cancelled'].value_counts()[1]
c2 = data.shape[0]
print("Number of cancelled transactions: ", c1)
print('Percent of orders cancelled: {}/{} ({:.2f}%) '.format(c1, c2, c1/c2*100))
```  
*Number of cancelled transactions:  9288*
*Percent of orders cancelled: 9288/541909 (1.71%)*  
‚úÖ The cancellation rate is relatively low, indicating a generally stable order fulfillment process.

***1.3. Clean data, create df_Transaction***


```python
# Create a copy of the 'data' dataframe
df_Transaction = data.copy()

# Remove canceled transactions
df_Transaction = df_Transaction[df_Transaction['order_cancelled'] == 0]

# Drop the 'Description' column
df_Transaction = df_Transaction.drop(columns=['Description'])

# Remove rows with missing CustomerID
df_Transaction = df_Transaction.dropna(subset=['CustomerID'])

# Check for duplicates
print('Duplicate entries: {}'.format(df_Transaction.duplicated().sum()))
print('{}% rows are duplicate.'.format(round((df_Transaction.duplicated().sum()/df_Transaction.shape[0])*100),2))

# Drop duplicate data
df_Transaction.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Change data type for CustomerID and InvoiceDate
df_Transaction['CustomerID'] = df_Transaction['CustomerID'].astype(str)  # Convert CustomerID to object type
data['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(data['InvoiceDate'], format='%d/%m/%Y %H:%M')  # Convert InvoiceDate to datetime

# Remove negative UnitPrice and Quantity
df_Transaction = df_Transaction[(df_Transaction['UnitPrice'] > 0) & (df_Transaction['Quantity'] > 0)]

# Check EDA results
print(df_Transaction.head())
print(df_Transaction.describe())
print(df_Transaction.dtypes)
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **2. Calculate RFM**  

***2.1. Calculate RFM***


```python
# Create Revenue column
df_Transaction['Revenue'] = df_Transaction['UnitPrice'] * df_Transaction['Quantity']
```

‚≠ê In RFM, Recency (R) measures the time elapsed since a customer's last transaction until the present.  
‚û°Ô∏è  Since the dataset only includes transactions up to the latest recorded date, we set last_date as the following day to avoid a zero gap when calculating Recency.   

```python
# To display only the date in InvoiceDate
from datetime import datetime
df_Transaction["InvoiceDate"] = df_Transaction["InvoiceDate"].dt.date

import datetime as dt
last_date = max(df_Transaction.InvoiceDate) + dt.timedelta(days=1)
```


```python
df_rfm = df_Transaction.groupby('CustomerID').agg({'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (last_date - x.max()).days, 'InvoiceNo': lambda x: len(x), 'Revenue': lambda x: x.sum()}).reset_index()
df_rfm['InvoiceDate'] = df_rfm['InvoiceDate'].astype(int)

# Rename columns
df_rfm.rename(columns={'InvoiceDate': 'Recency',
                         'InvoiceNo': 'Frequency',
                         'Revenue': 'Monetary'}, inplace=True)
df_rfm.head()
```

</p>


***2.2. Calculate RFM Score***
```python
# Calculate Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) scores
df_rmf['R_Score'] = pd.qcut(df_rmf['Recency'], 5, labels=[5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
df_rmf['F_Score'] = pd.qcut(df_rmf['Frequency'], 5, labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
df_rmf['M_Score'] = pd.qcut(df_rmf['Monetary'], 5, labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Combine R, F, and M scores into a single string
df_rmf['RFM_Score'] = df_rmf['R_Score'].astype(str) + df_rmf['F_Score'].astype(str) + df_rmf['M_Score'].astype(str)

# The result is a DataFrame containing columns R_Score, F_Score, M_Score, and RFM_Score
print(df_rmf[['CustomerID', 'Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary', 'RFM_Score']])
```

# **3. Segmentation**
```python
# Calculate the number of customers in each segment.
df_segment_data = df_user.groupby('Segment').agg({'CustomerID': lambda x: len(x),
                                                   'Recency': lambda x: x.mean(),
                                                   'Frequency': lambda x: x.sum(),
                                                   'Monetary': lambda x: x.sum()}).reset_index()

df_segment_data.rename(columns={'CustomerID': 'Count'}, inplace=True)
df_segment_data['percent'] = (df_segment_data['Count'] / df_segment_data['Count'].sum()) * 100
df_segment_data['percent'] = df_segment_data['percent'].round(1)

# Rename columns after calculating the aggregations
df_segment_data.rename(columns={'Recency': 'Avg Recency', 
                                 'Frequency': 'Orders', 
                                 'Monetary': 'Sales'}, inplace=True)

df_segment_data['Avg Recency'] = df_segment_data['Avg Recency'].round(1)
df_segment_data['Avg orders'] = (df_segment_data['Orders'] / df_segment_data['Count']).round(1) # Use 'Count' instead of 'Number of Customers'
df_segment_data['Avg sales'] = (df_segment_data['Sales'] / df_segment_data['Count']).round(1)  # Use 'Count' instead of 'Number of Customers'

print(df_segment_data)
```
